# LiteraryHub - AI Experimental Repository README

Welcome to the AI Experimental Repository. This repository contains Python-based code and Jupyter Notebooks for various AI experiments. The main codebase is located in the [ai-backend](https://github.com/LiteraryHub/ai-backend) repository, while this repository is dedicated to experimental and exploratory work.

## Overview

This repository is designed for conducting AI experiments, prototyping new models, and testing innovative ideas using Jupyter Notebooks. It is a complementary resource to the main AI backend system, enabling rapid experimentation and iterative development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the repository on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-experimental-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```sh
   cd ai-experimental-repo
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

To start experimenting with the provided Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open a Notebook**

   In your web browser, navigate to the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. From there, you can open any of the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory and start experimenting.

### Integration with AI Backend

This repository is intended to work in conjunction with the [ai-backend](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-backend) repository. You can run experiments here and integrate successful models or approaches into the main backend codebase.
